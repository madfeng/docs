"MongoDB uses *write ahead logging* to an on-disk :term:`journal` to "
"guarantee :doc:`write operation </core/write-operations>` durability and to "
"provide crash resiliency. Before applying a change to the data files, "
"MongoDB writes the change operation to the journal. If MongoDB should "
"terminate or encounter an error before it can write the changes from the "
"journal to the data files, MongoDB can re-apply the write operation and "
"maintain a consistent state."
