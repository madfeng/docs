"Before installing MongoDB, you can validate packages using either a PGP "
"signature or with MD5 and SHA checksums of the MongoDB packages. The PGP "
"signatures store an encrypted hash of the software package, that you can "
"validate to ensure that the package you have is consistent with the official"
" package release. MongoDB also publishes MD5 and SHA hashes of the official "
"packages that you can use to confirm that you have a valid package."
