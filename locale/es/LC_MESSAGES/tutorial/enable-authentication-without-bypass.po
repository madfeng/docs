"Enabling authentication on a MongoDB instance restricts access to the "
"instance by requiring that users identify themselves when connecting. In "
"this procedure, you will create the instance's first user, which must be a "
"user administrator and then enable authentication. Then, you can "
"authenticate as the user administrator to create additional users and grant "
"additional access to the instance."
