"All indexes in MongoDB are :term:`B-tree` indexes, which can efficiently "

"index entries supports efficient range-based operations and allows MongoDB "
"to return sorted results using the order of documents in the index."

"MongoDB indexes may be ascending, (i.e. ``1``) or descending (i.e. ``-1``) "
"in their ordering. Nevertheless, MongoDB may also traverse the index in "
"either directions. As a result, for single-field indexes, ascending and "
"descending indexes are interchangeable. This is not the case for compound "
"indexes: in compound indexes, the direction of the sort order can have a "
"greater impact on the results."
