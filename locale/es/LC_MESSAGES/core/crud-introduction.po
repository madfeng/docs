"In MongoDB a query targets a specific collection of documents. Queries "
"specify criteria, or conditions, that identify the documents that MongoDB "
"returns to the clients. A query may include a *projection* that specifies "
"the fields from the matching documents to return. You can optionally modify "
"queries to impose limits, skips, and sort orders."

"To enhance the performance of common queries and updates, MongoDB has full "
"support for secondary indexes. These indexes allow applications to store a "
"*view* of a portion of the collection in an efficient data structure. Most "
"indexes store an ordered representation of all values of a field or a group "
"of fields. Indexes may also :ref:`enforce uniqueness <index-type-unique>`, "
"store objects in a :doc:`geospatial representation </applications"
"/geospatial-indexes>`, and facilitate :doc:`text search </core/index-text>`."

"For replica sets and sharded clusters with replica set components, "

"Applications can also control the behavior of write operations using "
":ref:`write concern <write-concern>`. Particularly useful for deployments "
"with replica sets, the write concern semantics allow clients to specify the "
"assurance that MongoDB provides when reporting on the success of a write "
"operation."

"In addition to the basic queries, MongoDB provides several data aggregation "
"features. For example, MongoDB can return counts of the number of documents "
"that match a query, or return the number of distinct values for a field, or "
"process a collection of documents using a versatile stage-based data "
"processing pipeline or map-reduce operations."
