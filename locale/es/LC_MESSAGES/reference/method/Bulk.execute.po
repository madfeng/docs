"When executing an :method:`ordered "

"groups the operations by the :data:`operation type <batchType>` and "
"contiguity; i.e. *contiguous* operations of the same type are grouped "
"together. For example, if an ordered list has two insert operations followed"
" by an update operation followed by another insert operation, MongoDB groups"
" the operations into three separate groups: first group contains the two "
"insert operations, second group contains the update operation, and the third"
" group contains the last insert operation. This behavior is subject to "
