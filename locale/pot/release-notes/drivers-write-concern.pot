msgid "The drivers will call :dbcommand:`getLastError` without arguments, which is logically equivalent to the ``w: 1`` option; however, this operation allows :term:`replica set` users to override the default write concern with the :data:`~local.system.replset.settings.getLastErrorDefaults` setting in the :doc:`/reference/replica-configuration`."
