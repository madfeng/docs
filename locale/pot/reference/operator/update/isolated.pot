msgid "The :update:`$isolated` isolation operator **isolates** a write operation that affects multiple documents so that once the first document is changed the operation will not yield, to allow reads or writes, until all documents are written. This significantly affects the concurrency of the system as it holds the write lock much longer than normal."

msgid "Without the :update:`$isolated` operator, multi-updates will allow other operations to interleave with these updates. By specifying :update:`$isolated` you can guarantee isolation for the entire multi-update so no other clients sees the changes until the operation is finished (or errors -- see the note above)."
