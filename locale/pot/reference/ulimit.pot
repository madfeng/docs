msgid "Most UNIX-like operating systems, including Linux and OS X, provide ways to limit and control the usage of system resources such as threads, files, and network connections on a per-process and per-user basis. These \"ulimits\" prevent single users from using too many system resources. Sometimes, these limits have low default values that can cause a number of issues in the course of normal MongoDB operation."
