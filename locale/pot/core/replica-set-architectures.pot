msgid "*Fault tolerance* for a replica set is the number of members that can become unavailable and still leave enough members in the set to elect a primary. In other words, it is the difference between the number of members in the set and the majority needed to elect a primary. Without a primary, a replica set cannot accept write operations. Fault tolerance is an effect of replica set size, but the relationship is not direct. See the following table:"
