msgid "By default, an application directs its read operations to the :term:`primary` member in a :term:`replica set`. Reading from the primary guarantees that read operations reflect the latest version of a document. However, by distributing some or all reads to secondary members of the replica set, you can improve read throughput or reduce latency for an application that does not require fully up-to-date data."
