msgid "The deployment of a replica set affects the outcome of failover situations. To support effective failover, ensure that one facility can elect a primary if needed. Choose the facility that hosts the core application systems to host the majority of the replica set. Place a majority of voting members and all the members that can become primary in this facility. Otherwise, network partitions could prevent the set from being able to form a majority."
