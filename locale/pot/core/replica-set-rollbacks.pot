msgid "A rollback reverts write operations on a former :term:`primary` when the member rejoins its :term:`replica set` after a :term:`failover`. A rollback is necessary only if the primary had accepted write operations that the :term:`secondaries <secondary>` had **not** successfully replicated before the primary stepped down. When the primary rejoins the set as a secondary, it reverts, or \"rolls back,\" its write operations to maintain database consistency with the other members."
