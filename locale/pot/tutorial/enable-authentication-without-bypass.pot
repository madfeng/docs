msgid "Enabling authentication on a MongoDB instance restricts access to the instance by requiring that users identify themselves when connecting. In this procedure, you will create the instance's first user, which must be a user administrator and then enable authentication. Then, you can authenticate as the user administrator to create additional users and grant additional access to the instance."

msgid "This document outlines a procedure for enabling authentication for MongoDB instance where you create the first user on an existing MongoDB system that does not require authentication before restarting the instance and requiring authentication. You can use the :ref:`localhost exception <localhost-exception>` to gain access to a system with no users and authentication enabled. See :doc:`/tutorial/enable-authentication` for the description of that procedure."
