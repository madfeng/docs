msgid "For a ``text`` index, the *weight* of an indexed field denotes the significance of the field relative to the other indexed fields in terms of the score. The score for a given word in a document is derived from the weighted sum of the frequency for each of the indexed fields in that document. See :projection:`$meta` operator for details on returning and sorting by text scores."
