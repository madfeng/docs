msgid "Selectivity is the ability of a query to narrow results using the index. Effective indexes are more selective and allow MongoDB to use the index for a larger portion of the work associated with fulfilling the query."

msgid "To ensure selectivity, write queries that limit the number of possible documents with the indexed field. Write queries that are appropriately selective relative to your indexed data."

# a01a47f88b9641e0b8fab43a00ee56bf
msgid "Suppose you have a field called ``status`` where the possible values are ``new`` and ``processed``. If you add an index on ``status`` you've created a low-selectivity index. The index will be of little help in locating records."

# 3e12e9c98ed54725acbe1dd1a9218376
msgid "A better strategy, depending on your queries, would be to create a :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>` that includes the low-selectivity field and another field. For example, you could create a compound index on ``status`` and ``created_at.``"

msgid "If you query for ``{ a: 2, b: \"no\" }`` MongoDB must scan 3 :term:`documents <document>` in the collection to return the one matching result. Similarly, a query for ``{ a: { $gt: 1}, b: \"tv\" }`` must scan 6 documents, also to return one result."

msgid "If you query for ``{ a: 2, b: \"cd\" }``, MongoDB must scan only one document to fulfill the query. The index and query are more selective because the values of ``a`` are evenly distributed *and* the query can select a specific document using the index."
