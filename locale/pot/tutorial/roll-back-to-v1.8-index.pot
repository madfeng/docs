msgid "To build pre-2.0 indexes, use the :method:`dropIndexes() <db.collection.dropIndexes()>` and :method:`ensureIndex() <db.collection.ensureIndex()>` methods. You *cannot* simply reindex the collection. When you reindex on versions that only support ``{v:0}`` indexes, the ``v`` fields in the index definition still hold values of ``1``, even though the indexes would now use the ``{v:0}`` format. If you were to upgrade again to version 2.0 or later, these indexes would not work."
