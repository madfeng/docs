msgid "The administration of :term:`replica sets <replica set>` includes the initial deployment of the set, adding and removing members to a set, and configuring the operational parameters and properties of the set. Administrators generally need not intervene in failover or replication processes as MongoDB automates these functions. In the exceptional situations that require manual interventions, the tutorials in these sections describe processes such as resyncing a member. The tutorials in this section form the basis for all replica set administration."
