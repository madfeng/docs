"The :doc:`command line </reference/program/mongod>` and :doc:`configuration "
"file </reference/configuration-options>` interfaces provide MongoDB "

"While both interfaces provide access to the same collection of options and "
"settings, this document primarily uses the configuration file interface. If "
"you run MongoDB using a control script or installed from a package for your "
"operating system, you likely already have a configuration file located at "
"``/etc/mongodb.conf``. Confirm this by checking the contents of the "
"``/etc/init.d/mongod`` or ``/etc/rc.d/mongod`` script to ensure that the "

":setting:`~processManagement.fork` is ``true``, which enables a "
