"Always restore :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` as a whole. When "
"you restore a single shard, keep in mind that the :term:`balancer` process "
"might have moved :term:`chunks <chunk>` to or from this shard since the last"
" backup. If that's the case, you must manually move those chunks, as "
"described in this procedure."

"For all chunks that migrate away from this shard, you do not need to do "
"anything at this time. You do not need to delete these documents from the "
"shard because the chunks are automatically filtered out from queries by "
":program:`mongos`. You can remove these documents from the shard, if you "
"like, at your leisure."

"For chunks that migrate to this shard after the most recent backup, you must"
" manually recover the chunks using backups of other shards, or some other "
"source.  To determine what chunks have moved, view the ``changelog`` "
"collection in the :ref:`config-database`."
