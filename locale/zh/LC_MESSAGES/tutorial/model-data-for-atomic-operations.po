"In MongoDB, write operations, e.g. :method:`db.collection.update()`, "
":method:`db.collection.findAndModify()`, :method:`db.collection.remove()`, "
"are atomic on the level of a single document. For fields that must be "
"updated together, embedding the fields within the same document ensures that"
" the fields can be updated atomically."

"For example, consider a situation where you need to maintain information on "
"books, including the number of copies available for checkout as well as the "
"current checkout information."

"The available copies of the book and the checkout information should be in "
"sync. As such, embedding the ``available`` field and the ``checkout`` field "
"within the same document ensures that you can update the two fields "
"atomically."

"Then to update with new checkout information, you can use the "
":method:`db.collection.update()` method to atomically update both the "
"``available`` field and the ``checkout`` field:"
