"Log rotation using MongoDB's standard approach archives the current log file"
" and starts a new one. To do this, the :program:`mongod` or "
":program:`mongos` instance renames the current log file by appending a UTC "
"(GMT) timestamp to the filename, in :term:`ISODate` format. It then opens a "
"new log file, closes the old log file, and sends all new log entries to the "
"new log file."
