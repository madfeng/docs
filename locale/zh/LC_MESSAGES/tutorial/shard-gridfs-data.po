"Most deployments will not need to shard the ``files`` collection. The "
"``files`` collection is typically small, and only contains metadata. None of"
" the required keys for GridFS lend themselves to an even distribution in a "
"sharded situation. If you *must* shard the ``files`` collection, use the "
"``_id`` field possibly in combination with an application field."

"Leaving ``files`` unsharded means that all the file metadata documents live "
"on one shard. For production GridFS stores you *must* store the ``files`` "
