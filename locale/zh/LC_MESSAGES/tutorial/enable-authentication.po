"Enabling access control on a MongoDB instance restricts access to the "
"instance by requiring that users identify themselves when connecting. In "
"this procedure, you enable access control and then create the instance's "
"first user, which must be a user administrator. The user administrator "
"grants further access to the instance by creating additional users."
