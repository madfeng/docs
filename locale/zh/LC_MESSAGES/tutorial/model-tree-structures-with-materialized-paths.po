"The *Materialized Paths* pattern stores each tree node in a document; in "
"addition to the tree node, document stores as a string the id(s) of the "
"node's ancestors or path. Although the *Materialized Paths* pattern requires"
" additional steps of working with strings and regular expressions, the "
"pattern also provides more flexibility in working with the path, such as "
"finding nodes by partial paths."
