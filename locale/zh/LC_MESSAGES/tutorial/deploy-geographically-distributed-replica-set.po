"While :term:`replica sets <replica set>` provide basic protection against "
"single-instance failure, replica sets whose members are all located in a "
"single facility are susceptible to errors in that facility. Power outages, "
"network interruptions, and natural disasters are all issues that can affect "
"replica sets whose members are colocated. To protect against these classes "
"of failures, deploy a replica set with one or more members in a "
"geographically distinct facility or data center to provide redundancy."
