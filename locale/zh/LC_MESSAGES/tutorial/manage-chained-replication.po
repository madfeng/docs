"Starting in version 2.0, MongoDB supports chained replication. A chained "
"replication occurs when a :term:`secondary` member replicates from another "
"secondary member instead of from the :term:`primary`. This might be the "
"case, for example, if a secondary selects its replication target based on "
"ping time and if the closest member is another secondary."

"Chained replication can reduce load on the primary. But chained replication "
"can also result in increased replication lag, depending on the topology of "
