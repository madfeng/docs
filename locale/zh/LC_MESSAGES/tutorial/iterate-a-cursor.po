"The :method:`db.collection.find()` method returns a cursor. To access the "
"documents, you need to iterate the cursor. However, in the :program:`mongo` "
"shell, if the returned cursor is not assigned to a variable using the "
"``var`` keyword, then the cursor is automatically iterated up to 20 times to"
" print up to the first 20 documents in the results. The following describes "
"ways to manually iterate the cursor to access the documents or to use the "
"iterator index."
