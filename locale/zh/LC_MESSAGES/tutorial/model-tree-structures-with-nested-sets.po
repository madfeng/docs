"Data in MongoDB has a *flexible schema*. :term:`Collections <collection>` do"
" not enforce :term:`document` structure. Decisions that affect how you model"
" data can affect application performance and database capacity. See "

"The *Nested Sets* pattern identifies each node in the tree as stops in a "
"round-trip traversal of the tree. The application visits each node in the "
"tree twice; first during the initial trip, and second during the return "
"trip. The *Nested Sets* pattern stores each tree node in a document; in "
"addition to the tree node, document stores the id of node's parent, the "
"node's initial stop in the ``left`` field, and its return stop in the "
"``right`` field."

"The *Nested Sets* pattern provides a fast and efficient solution for finding"
" subtrees but is inefficient for modifying the tree structure. As such, this"
