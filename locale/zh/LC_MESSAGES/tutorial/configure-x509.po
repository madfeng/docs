"MongoDB supports x.509 certificate authentication for use with a secure "
":doc:`SSL connection </tutorial/configure-ssl>`. The x.509 authentication "
"allows :ref:`clients to authenticate to servers with certificates <x509"
"-client-authentication>` instead of with username and password. The x.509 "
"authentication also allows sharded cluster members and replica set members "
"to use x.509 certificates to :ref:`verify their membership to the cluster or"
" the replica set <x509-internal-authentication>` instead of using "
