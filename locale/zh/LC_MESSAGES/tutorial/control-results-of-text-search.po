"For a ``text`` index, the *weight* of an indexed field denotes the "
"significance of the field relative to the other indexed fields in terms of "
"the score. The score for a given word in a document is derived from the "
"weighted sum of the frequency for each of the indexed fields in that "
"document. See :projection:`$meta` operator for details on returning and "
"sorting by text scores."
