msgid ""
"MongoDB is a :term:`document`\\-oriented DBMS. Think of MySQL but with "
":term:`JSON`-like objects comprising the data model, rather than RDBMS "
"tables. Significantly, MongoDB supports neither joins nor transactions. "
"However, it features secondary indexes, an expressive query language, atomic"
" writes on a per-document level, and fully-consistent reads."

msgid "Do MongoDB databases have tables?"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/faq/fundamentals.txt:35
msgid ""
"Instead of tables, a MongoDB database stores its data in :term:`collections "
"<collection>`, which are the rough equivalent of RDBMS tables. A collection "
"holds one or more :term:`documents <document>`, which corresponds to a "
"record or a row in a relational database table, and each document has one or"
" more fields, which corresponds to a column in a relational database table."

#: ../source/faq/fundamentals.txt:43
msgid ""
"Collections have important differences from RDBMS tables. Documents in a "
"single collection may have a unique combination and set of fields. Documents"
" need not have identical fields. You can add a field to some documents in a "
"collection without adding that field to all documents in the collection."

msgstr ""

#: ../source/faq/fundamentals.txt:56
msgid ""
"MongoDB uses dynamic schemas. You can create collections without defining "
"the structure, i.e. the fields or the types of their values, of the "
"documents in the collection. You can change the structure of documents "
"simply by adding new fields or deleting existing ones. Documents in a "
"collection need not have an identical set of fields."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/faq/fundamentals.txt:62
msgid ""
"In practice, it is common for the documents in a collection to have a "
"largely homogeneous structure; however, this is not a requirement. MongoDB's"
" flexible schemas mean that schema migration and augmentation are very easy "
"in practice, and you will rarely, if ever, need to write scripts that "
"perform \"alter table\" type operations, which simplifies and facilitates "
"iterative software development with MongoDB."

msgid ""
"However, MongoDB does provide atomic operations on a single document. Often "

msgstr ""

#: ../source/faq/fundamentals.txt:114
msgid ""
"For example, in MongoDB, you can embed related data in nested arrays or "
"nested documents within a single document and update the entire document in "
"a single atomic operation. Relational databases might represent the same "
"kind of data with multiple tables and rows, which would require transaction "
"support to update the data atomically."

"Does MongoDB require a separate caching layer for application-level caching?"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/faq/fundamentals.txt:154
msgid ""
"No. In MongoDB, a document's representation in the database is similar to "
"its representation in application memory. This means the database already "

"persistent store and in the application cache. This eliminates the need for "
"a separate caching layer in the application."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/faq/fundamentals.txt:160
msgid ""
"This differs from relational databases, where caching data is more "
"expensive. Relational databases must transform data into object "
"representations that applications can read and must store the transformed "
"data in a separate cache: if these transformation from data to application "
"objects require joins, this process increases the overhead related to using "
"the database which increases the importance of the caching layer."

#: ../source/faq/fundamentals.txt:171

msgid ""
"While the journal commit is nearly instant, MongoDB writes to the data files"
" lazily. MongoDB may wait to write data to the data files for as much as one"
