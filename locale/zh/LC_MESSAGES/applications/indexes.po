"The best indexes for your application must take a number of factors into "
"account, including the kinds of queries you expect, the ratio of reads to "
"writes, and the amount of free memory on your system."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/applications/indexes.txt:12
msgid ""
"When developing your indexing strategy you should have a deep understanding "
"of your application's queries. Before you build indexes, map out the types "
"of queries you will run so that you can build indexes that reference those "
"fields. Indexes come with a performance cost, but are more than worth the "
"cost for frequent queries on large data set. Consider the relative frequency"
" of each query in the application and whether the query justifies an index."

msgid ""
"The best overall strategy for designing indexes is to profile a variety of "
"index configurations with data sets similar to the ones you'll be running in"
" production to see which configurations perform best.Inspect the current "
"indexes created for your collections to ensure they are supporting your "
"current and planned queries. If an index is no longer used, drop the index."

"MongoDB can only use *one* index to support any given operation. However, "
"each clause of an :query:`$or` query may use a different index."

"An index supports a query when the index contains all the fields scanned by "
"the query. Creating indexes that supports queries results in greatly "

"When your index fits in RAM, the system can avoid reading the index from "
"disk and you get the fastest processing."

"Selectivity is the ability of a query to narrow results using the index. "
"Selectivity allows MongoDB to use the index for a larger portion of the work"
" associated with fulfilling the query."
