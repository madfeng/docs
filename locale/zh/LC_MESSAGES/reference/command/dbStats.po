"The :dbcommand:`dbStats` command returns storage statistics for a given "
"database. The command takes the following syntax:"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/command/dbStats.txt:19
msgid ""
"The values of the options above do not affect the output of the command. The"
" ``scale`` option allows you to specify how to scale byte values. For "
"example, a ``scale`` value of ``1024`` will display the results in kilobytes"
" rather than in bytes:"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/command/dbStats.txt:30
msgid ""
"Because scaling rounds values to whole numbers, scaling may return unlikely "
"or unexpected results."

"The time required to run the command depends on the total size of the "
