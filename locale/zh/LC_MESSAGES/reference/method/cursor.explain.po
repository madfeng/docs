#: ../source/reference/method/cursor.explain.txt:35
msgid ""
"The :method:`~cursor.explain()` method runs the actual query to determine "
"the result. Although there are some differences between running the query "
"with :method:`~cursor.explain()` and running without, generally, the "
"performance will be similar between the two. So, if the query is slow, the "
":method:`~cursor.explain()` operation is also slow."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/method/cursor.explain.txt:41
msgid ""
"Additionally, the :method:`~cursor.explain()` operation reevaluates a set of"
" candidate query plans, which may cause the :method:`~cursor.explain()` "
"operation to perform differently than a normal query. As a result, these "
"operations generally provide an accurate account of *how* MongoDB would "
"perform the query, but do not reflect the length of these queries."
