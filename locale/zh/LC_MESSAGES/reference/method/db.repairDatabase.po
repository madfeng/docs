":method:`db.repairDatabase()` provides a wrapper around the database command"
" :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`, and has the same effect as the run-time option"
" :option:`mongod --repair` option, limited to *only* the current database. "

"During normal operations, only use the :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` command "
"and wrappers including :method:`db.repairDatabase()` in the :program:`mongo`"
" shell and :option:`mongod --repair`, to compact database files and/or "
"reclaim disk space. Be aware that these operations remove and do not save "
"any corrupt data during the repair process."

"If you are trying to repair a :term:`replica set` member, and you have "
"access to an intact copy of your data (e.g. a recent backup or an intact "
"member of the :term:`replica set`), you should restore from that intact "
"copy, and **not** use :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`."

"When using :term:`journaling <journal>`, there is almost never any need to "
