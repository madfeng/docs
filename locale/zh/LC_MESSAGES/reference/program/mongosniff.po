":program:`mongosniff` provides a low-level operation tracing/sniffing view "
"into database activity in real time. Think of :program:`mongosniff` as a "
"MongoDB-specific analogue of ``tcpdump`` for TCP/IP network traffic. "
"Typically, :program:`mongosniff` is most frequently used in driver "
"development."

":program:`mongosniff` requires ``libpcap`` and is only available for Unix-"
"like systems. Furthermore, the version distributed with the MongoDB binaries"
" is dynamically linked against aversion 0.9 of ``libpcap``. If your system "
"has a different version of ``libpcap``, you will need to compile "
":program:`mongosniff` yourself or create a symbolic link pointing to "
"``libpcap.so.0.9`` to your local version of ``libpcap``. Use an operation "
"that resembles the following:"
