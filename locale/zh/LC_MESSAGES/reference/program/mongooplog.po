msgid ""
":program:`mongooplog` is a simple tool that polls operations from the "
":term:`replication` :term:`oplog` of a remote server, and applies them to "
"the local server. This capability supports certain classes of real-time "
"migrations that require that the source server remain online and in "
"operation throughout the migration process."
