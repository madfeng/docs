"Most UNIX-like operating systems, including Linux and OS X, provide ways to "
"limit and control the usage of system resources such as threads, files, and "
"network connections on a per-process and per-user basis. These \"ulimits\" "
"prevent single users from using too many system resources. Sometimes, these "
"limits have low default values that can cause a number of issues in the "
"course of normal MongoDB operation."
