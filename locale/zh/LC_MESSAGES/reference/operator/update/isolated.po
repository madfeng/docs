"The :update:`$isolated` isolation operator **isolates** a write operation "
"that affects multiple documents so that once the first document is changed "
"the operation will not yield, to allow reads or writes, until all documents "
"are written. This significantly affects the concurrency of the system as it "
"holds the write lock much longer than normal."

"so no other clients sees the changes until the operation is finished (or "
"errors -- see the note above)."
