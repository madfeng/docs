msgid ""
"The :query:`$geoWithin` operator is a geospatial query operator that queries"
" for a defined point, line or shape that exists entirely within another "
"defined shape. When determining inclusion, MongoDB considers the border of a"
" shape to be part of the shape, subject to the precision of floating point "
"numbers."

"The :query:`$geoWithin` operator does not return sorted results. As a result"
" MongoDB can return :query:`$geoWithin` queries more quickly than geospatial"

":query:`$geoWithin` does not require a geospatial index. However, a "
