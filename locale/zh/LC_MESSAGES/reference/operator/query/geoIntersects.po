"The :query:`$geoIntersects` operator is a geospatial query operator that "
"selects all locations that intersect with a :term:`GeoJSON` object. A "
"location intersects a GeoJSON object if the intersection is non-empty. This "
"includes documents that have a shared edge. The :query:`$geoIntersects` "
"operator uses spherical geometry."
