"The :query:`$box` operator specifies a rectangle for a :term:`geospatial` "
":query:`$geoWithin` query. The query returns documents that are within the "
"bounds of the rectangle, according to their point-based location data. The "
":query:`$box` operator returns documents based on :ref:`grid coordinates "
"<geospatial-indexes-store-grid-coordinates>` and does *not* query for "
"GeoJSON shapes."

"Applications can use |operator| *without* having a geospatial index. "
"However, geospatial indexes support much faster queries than the unindexed "
"equivalents. Before 2.2.3, a geospatial index *must* exist on a field "
"holding coordinates before using any of the geospatial query operators."
