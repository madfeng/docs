"Specify a :operator:`$min` value to specify the *inclusive* lower bound for "

"You can explicitly specify the corresponding index with "
":method:`~cursor.hint()`. Otherwise, MongoDB selects the index using the "

"Because :method:`~cursor.min()` requires an index on a field, and forces the"

"The query will use the index on the ``age`` field, even if the index on "
