"These examples return all documents in the collection named ``collection`` "

"The sort function requires that the entire sort be able to complete within "
"32 megabytes. When the sort option consumes more than 32 megabytes, MongoDB "
"will return an error."

"To avoid this error, create an index to support the sort operation or use "
":operator:`$orderby` in conjunction with :operator:`$maxScan` and/or "
":method:`cursor.limit()`. The :method:`cursor.limit()` increases the speed "
"and reduces the amount of memory required to return this query by way of an "
"optimized algorithm. The specified limit must result in a number of "
"documents that fall within the 32 megabyte limit."
