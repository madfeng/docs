":program:`mongodump` provides a method for creating :term:`BSON` dump files "
"from the :program:`mongod` instances, while :program:`mongorestore` makes it"
" possible to restore these dumps. :program:`bsondump` converts BSON dump "
"files into :term:`JSON`. The :program:`mongooplog` utility provides the "

":program:`mongoimport` provides a method for taking data in :term:`JSON`, "
":term:`CSV`, or :term:`TSV` and importing it into a :program:`mongod` "
