"As of the releases listed below, there are two major changes to all drivers:"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/release-notes/drivers-write-concern.txt:21
msgid ""
"All drivers will add a new top-level connection class that will increase "
"consistency for all MongoDB client interfaces."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/release-notes/drivers-write-concern.txt:24
msgid ""
"This change is non-backward breaking: existing connection classes will "
"remain in all drivers for a time, and will continue to operate as expected. "
"However, those previous connection classes are now deprecated as of these "
"releases, and will eventually be removed from the driver interfaces."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/release-notes/drivers-write-concern.txt:30
msgid ""
"The new top-level connection class is named ``MongoClient``, or similar "
"depending on how host languages handle namespacing."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/release-notes/drivers-write-concern.txt:33
msgid ""
"The default write concern on the new ``MongoClient`` class will be to "
"acknowledge all write operations [#without-arguments]_. This will allow your"
" application to receive acknowledgment of all write operations."

"See the documentation of :ref:`Write Concern <write-concern>` for more "
"information about write concern in MongoDB."

msgstr ""

#: ../source/release-notes/drivers-write-concern.txt:43
msgid ""
"The drivers will call :dbcommand:`getLastError` without arguments, which is "
"logically equivalent to the ``w: 1`` option; however, this operation allows "
":term:`replica set` users to override the default write concern with the "
":data:`~local.system.replset.settings.getLastErrorDefaults` setting in the "
":doc:`/reference/replica-configuration`."
