      Insert a document into a collection named ``inventory``. The
      operation will create the collection if the collection does not
      currently exist.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      db.inventory.insert(
         {
           item: "ABC1",
           details: {
              model: "14Q3",
              manufacturer: "XYZ Company"
           },
           stock: [ { size: "S", qty: 25 }, { size: "M", qty: 50 } ],
           category: "clothing"
         }
      )
  - pre: |
      The operation returns a :method:`WriteResult` object with the status
      of the operation. A successful insert of the
      document returns the following object:
    language: javascript
    code: |
       WriteResult({ "nInserted" : 1 })
    post: |
      The :data:`~WriteResult.nInserted` field specifies the number of
      documents inserted. If the operation encounters an error, the
      :method:`WriteResult` object will contain the error information.

     If the insert operation is successful, verify the insertion by
     querying the collection.
    language: javascript
    code: |
       db.inventory.find()
  - pre: |
     The document you inserted should return.
    language: javascript
    code: |
       { "_id" : ObjectId("53d98f133bb604791249ca99"), "item" : "ABC1", "details" : { "model" : "14Q3", "manufacturer" : "XYZ Company" }, "stock" : [ { "size" : "S", "qty" : 25 }, { "size" : "M", "qty" : 50 } ], "category" : "clothing" }

  The returned document shows that MongoDB added an ``_id`` field to
  the document. If a client inserts a document that does not contain
  the ``_id`` field, MongoDB adds the field with the value set to a
  generated :manual:`ObjectId </reference/object-id>`. The
  :manual:`ObjectId </reference/object-id>` values in your documents
  will differ from the ones shown.
