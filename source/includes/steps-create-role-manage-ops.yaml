  ``manageOpRole`` has privileges that act on multiple databases as well
  as the :ref:`cluster resource <resource-cluster>`. As such, you must
  create the role in the ``admin`` database.
action:
  language: javascript
  code: |
    use admin
    db.createRole(
       {
         role: "manageOpRole", 
         privileges: [
           { resource: { cluster: true }, actions: [ "killop", "inprog" ] },
           { resource: { db: "", collection: "" }, actions: [ "killCursors" ] }
         ],
         roles: []
       }
    )
post: |
  The new role grants permissions to kill any operations.
