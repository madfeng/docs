Kerberos Configuration Checklist
--------------------------------

If you have difficulty starting :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos`
with :doc:`Kerberos </core/kerberos>` on Linux systems, ensure that:


- The :program:`mongod` and the :program:`mongos` binaries are from
  MongoDB Enterprise. 

  .. include:: /includes/fact-confirm-enterprise-binaries.rst

- You are not using the :ecosystem:`HTTP Console
  </tools/http-interface/#http-console>`. MongoDB Enterprise
  does not support Kerberos authentication over the HTTP Console
  interface.

- Either the service principal name (SPN) in the :ref:`keytab file
  <keytab-files>` matches the SPN for the :program:`mongod` or
  :program:`mongos` instance, or the :program:`mongod` or the
  :program:`mongos` instance use the :parameter:`--setParameter
  saslHostName=\<host name\> <saslHostName>` to match the name in the
  keytab file.

- The canonical system hostname of the system that runs the
  :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` instance is a resolvable,
  fully qualified domain for this host. You can test the system
  hostname resolution with the ``hostname -f`` command at the system
  prompt.

- Each host that runs a :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` instance
  has both the ``A`` and ``PTR`` DNS records to provide forward and
  reverse lookup. The records allow the host to resolve the components
  of the Kerberos infrastructure.

- Both the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) and the system
  running :program:`mongod` instance or :program:`mongos` must be able
  to resolve each other using DNS. By default, Kerberos attempts to
  resolve hosts using the content of the ``/etc/kerb5.conf`` before
  using DNS to resolve hosts.

- The time synchronization of the systems running :program:`mongod` or
  the :program:`mongos` instances and the Kerberos infrastructure are
  within the maximum time skew (default is 5 minutes) of each other.
  Time differences greater than the maximum time skew will prevent
  successful authentication.

Debug with More Verbose Logs
----------------------------

If you still encounter problems with Kerberos on Linux, you can start
both :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongo` (or another client) with
the environment variable ``KRB5_TRACE`` set to different files to
produce more verbose logging of the Kerberos process to help further
troubleshooting. For example, the following starts a standalone
:program:`mongod` with ``KRB5_TRACE`` set:

.. code-block:: sh

   env KRB5_KTNAME=/opt/mongodb/mongod.keytab \
       KRB5_TRACE=/opt/mongodb/log/mongodb-kerberos.log \
       /opt/mongodb/bin/mongod --dbpath /opt/mongodb/data \
       --fork --logpath /opt/mongodb/log/mongod.log \
       --auth --setParameter authenticationMechanisms=GSSAPI

Common Error Messages
---------------------

In some situations, MongoDB will return error messages from the GSSAPI
interface if there is a problem with the Kerberos service. Some common
error messages are:

``GSSAPI error in client while negotiating security context.``
  This error occurs on the client and reflects insufficient credentials
  or a malicious attempt to authenticate.

  If you receive this error, ensure that you are using the correct
  credentials and the correct fully qualified domain name when
  connecting to the host.

``GSSAPI error acquiring credentials.``
  This error occurs during the start of the :program:`mongod` or
  :program:`mongos` and reflects improper configuration of the system
  hostname or a missing or incorrectly configured keytab file.

  If you encounter this problem, consider the items in the
  :ref:`kerberos-troubleshooting-checklist`, in particular, whether the
  SPN in the :ref:`keytab file <keytab-files>` matches the SPN for the
  :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` instance.

  To determine whether the SPNs match:

  #. Examine the keytab file, with the following command:

     .. code-block:: sh

        klist -k <keytab>

     Replace ``<keytab>`` with the path to your keytab file.

  #. Check the configured hostname for your system, with the following
     command:

     .. code-block:: sh

        hostname -f

     Ensure that this name matches the name in the keytab file, or
     start :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` with the
     :parameter:`--setParameter saslHostName=\<hostname\> <saslHostName>`.
