Manage In-Progress Index Creation
=================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

View Index Creation Operations
------------------------------

To see the status of an indexing process, you can use the
:method:`db.currentOp()` method in the :program:`mongo` shell. To
filter the current operations for index creation operations, see
:ref:`currentOp-index-creation` for an example.

The :data:`~currentOp.msg` field will include the percent of the build
that is complete.

Terminate Index Creation
------------------------

To terminate an ongoing index build, use the :method:`db.killOp()`
method in the :program:`mongo` shell. For index builds, the effects of
:method:`db.killOp()` may not be immediate and may occur well after
much of the index build operation has completed.

You cannot terminate a *replicated* index build on secondary members
of a replica set. To minimize the impact of building an index on
replica sets, see :doc:`/tutorial/build-indexes-on-replica-sets`.

.. versionchanged:: 2.4

   Before MongoDB 2.4, you could *only* terminate *background* index
   builds. After 2.4, you can terminate both *background* index builds
   and foreground index builds.
