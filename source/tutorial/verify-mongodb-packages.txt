====================================
Verify Integrity of MongoDB Packages
====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

The MongoDB release team digitally signs all software packages to
certify that a particular MongoDB package is a valid and unaltered
MongoDB release.

Before installing MongoDB, you can validate packages using either a PGP
signature or with MD5 and SHA checksums of the MongoDB packages. The PGP
signatures store an encrypted hash of the software package, that you
can validate to ensure that the package you have is consistent with
the official package release. MongoDB also publishes MD5 and SHA hashes of
the official packages that you can use to confirm that you have a
valid package.

Considerations
--------------

MongoDB signs each release branch with a different PGP key.

The public ``.asc`` and ``.pub`` key files for each branch are
available for download. For example, the 2.2 keys are available at the
following URLs:

.. code-block:: ini

   https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-2.2.asc
   https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-2.2.pub

Replace ``2.2`` with the appropriate release number to download public
key. Keys are available for all MongoDB releases beginning with 2.2.

Procedures

Use PGP/GPG

Use SHA
+++++++

MongoDB provides checksums using both the SHA-1 and SHA-256
hash functions. You can use either, as you like.
