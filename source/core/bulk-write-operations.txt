Bulk Write Operations
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

MongoDB provides clients the ability to perform write operations in
bulk. Bulk write operations affect a *single* collection. MongoDB
allows applications to determine the acceptable level of
acknowledgement required for bulk write operations.

New :method:`Bulk` methods provide the ability to perform bulk insert,
update, and remove operations. MongoDB also supports bulk insert
through passing an array of documents to the
:method:`db.collection.insert()` method.

.. versionchanged:: 2.6

   Previous versions of MongoDB provided the ability for bulk inserts
   only. With previous versions, clients could perform bulk inserts by
   passing an array of documents to the :v2.4:`db.collection.insert()
   </core/bulk-inserts>` method. To see the documentation for earlier
   versions, see :v2.4:`Bulk Inserts </core/bulk-inserts>`.

Ordered vs Unordered Operations
-------------------------------

Bulk write operations can be either *ordered* or *unordered*. With an
ordered list of operations, MongoDB executes the operations serially.
If an error occurs during the processing of one of the write
operations, MongoDB will return without processing any remaining write
operations in the list.

With an unordered list of operations, MongoDB can execute the
operations in parallel. If an error occurs during the processing of one
of the write operations, MongoDB will continue to process remaining
write operations in the list.

Executing an ordered list of operations on a sharded collection will
generally be slower than executing an unordered list since with an
ordered list, each operation must wait for the previous operation to
finish.

``Bulk`` Methods
----------------

To use the :method:`Bulk()` methods:

#. Initialize a list of operations using either
   :method:`db.collection.initializeUnorderedBulkOp()` or
   :method:`db.collection.initializeOrderedBulkOp()`.

#. Add write operations to the list using the following methods:

   - :method:`Bulk.insert()` 
   - :method:`Bulk.find()`
   - :method:`Bulk.find.upsert()`
   - :method:`Bulk.find.update()`
   - :method:`Bulk.find.updateOne()`
   - :method:`Bulk.find.replaceOne()`
   - :method:`Bulk.find.remove()`
   - :method:`Bulk.find.removeOne()`

#. To execute the list of operations, use the :method:`Bulk.execute()`
   method. You can specify the write concern for the list in the
   :method:`Bulk.execute()` method.

   Once executed, you cannot re-execute the list without
   reinitializing.

For example,

.. code-block:: javascript

   var bulk = db.items.initializeUnorderedBulkOp();
   bulk.insert( { _id: 1, item: "abc123", status: "A", soldQty: 5000 } );
   bulk.insert( { _id: 2, item: "abc456", status: "A", soldQty: 150 } );
   bulk.insert( { _id: 3, item: "abc789", status: "P", soldQty: 0 } );
   bulk.execute( { w: "majority", wtimeout: 5000 } );

For more examples, refer to the reference page for each
:doc:`/reference/method/js-bulk` method. For information and examples
on performing bulk insert using the :method:`db.collection.insert()`,
see :method:`db.collection.insert()`.

``Bulk`` Execution Mechanics
----------------------------

When executing an :method:`ordered
<db.collection.initializeOrderedBulkOp()>` list of operations, MongoDB
groups adjacent operations by the :data:`operation type <batchType>`.
When executing an :method:`unordered
<db.collection.initializeUnorderedBulkOp()>` list of operations,
MongoDB groups and may also reorder the operations to increase
performance. As such, when performing *unordered* bulk operations,
applications should not depend on the ordering.

Strategies for Bulk Inserts to a Sharded Collection
---------------------------------------------------

Large bulk insert operations, including initial data inserts or routine
data import, can affect :term:`sharded cluster` performance. For
bulk inserts, consider the following strategies:

Pre-Split the Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the sharded collection is empty, then the collection has only
one initial :term:`chunk`, which resides on a single shard.
MongoDB must then take time to receive data, create splits, and
distribute the split chunks to the available shards. To avoid this
performance cost, you can pre-split the collection, as described in
:doc:`/tutorial/split-chunks-in-sharded-cluster`.

Insert to Multiple ``mongos``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To parallelize import processes, send bulk insert or insert operations
to more than one :program:`mongos` instance. For *empty* collections,
first pre-split the collection as described in
:doc:`/tutorial/split-chunks-in-sharded-cluster`.

Avoid Monotonic Throttling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your shard key increases monotonically during an insert, then all
inserted data goes to the last chunk in the collection, which will
always end up on a single shard. Therefore, the insert capacity of the
cluster will never exceed the insert capacity of that single shard.

If your insert volume is larger than what a single shard can process,
and if you cannot avoid a monotonically increasing shard key, then
consider the following modifications to your application:

- Reverse the binary bits of the shard key. This preserves the
  information and avoids correlating insertion order with increasing
  sequence of values.

- Swap the first and last 16-bit words to "shuffle" the inserts.

.. example:: The following example, in C++, swaps the leading and
   trailing 16-bit word of :term:`BSON` :term:`ObjectIds <ObjectId>`
   generated so they are no longer monotonically increasing.

   .. code-block:: cpp

      using namespace mongo;
      OID make_an_id() {
        OID x = OID::gen();
        const unsigned char *p = x.getData();
        swap( (unsigned short&) p[0], (unsigned short&) p[10] );
        return x;
      }

      void foo() {
        // create an object
        BSONObj o = BSON( "_id" << make_an_id() << "x" << 3 << "name" << "jane" );
        // now we may insert o into a sharded collection
      }

   on choosing a sharded key. Also see :ref:`Shard Key
   Internals <sharding-internals-shard-keys>` (in particular,
