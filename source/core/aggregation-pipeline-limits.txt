===========================
Aggregation Pipeline Limits
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Aggregation operations with the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command have the
following limitations.

Result Size Restrictions
------------------------

If the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command returns a single document that
contains the complete result set, the command will produce an error if
the result set exceeds the :limit:`BSON Document Size` limit, which is
currently 16 megabytes. To manage result sets that exceed this limit,
the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command can return result sets of *any size*
if the command return a cursor or store the results to a collection.

.. versionchanged:: 2.6

   The :dbcommand:`aggregate` command can return results as a cursor or
   store the results in a collection, which are not subject to the size
   limit. The :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` returns a cursor and
   can return result sets of any size.

.. Type Restrictions
.. -----------------
.. .. versionchanged:: 2.4
   Removed restriction on ``Binary`` type data. In MongoDB 2.2, the pipeline
   could not operate on ``Binary`` type data.
